# Sunquake Detection Repository 

This repository contains the codebase used in the automatic detection of Sunquakes corresponding to part of the work presented in [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-022-02081-7).

Datasets:

*    [SunquakeNet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vanessamercea/sunquake-net-c23-c24)
 
Currently, the repository covers the Self-Supervised and Supervised Contrastive Learning and Object Detection approaches, along with a guiding notebook that also includes additional techniques such as SMOTE, UMAP and SVC. In the near future, the repository will be updated to include the remaining classification techniques and to exemplify the usage of the Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning in the notebook.
